### Description

This repository is my fourth assignment for "Intro to Web Development" -- a React banking application.

It supports the following actions:
* Calculating the account balance
* Importing JSON files with default credits and debits
* Dynamically displaying the balance on the home, credit, and debit pages
* Display the list of credits/debits, with amounts, descriptions, and dates
* Add credits/debits on their respective pages
